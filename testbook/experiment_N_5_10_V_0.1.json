    "question": "How does Contoso's data classification into three levels influence its cloud security policies, particularly regarding data at rest and in transit?",
    "answer": "Contoso's classification of data into three levels significantly influences its cloud security policies by tailoring security measures to the sensitivity and value of the data. For data at rest, Contoso implements encryption at the highest levels for the most sensitive data (Level 3), ensuring compliance with regional regulations and protecting proprietary information through strong encryption, multi-factor authentication, and granular auditing [doc_3]. For data in transit, the policies mandate encryption methods such as HTTPS or IPsec to prevent plain text transmission, aligning with the highest security standards for sensitive data [doc_5]. Additionally, access controls based on least privilege principles are enforced, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific data levels, further strengthening security across the cloud environment [doc_4, doc_5].",

The headquarters, located in Paris, serves as the central management and data center hub, employing around 15,000 workers and hosting all major datacenters and internet infrastructure [doc_3]. Regional hubs, each with approximately 2,000 employees, are situated in key cities such as New York, Tokyo, Moscow, and Johannesburg. These hubs are connected to the headquarters via high-bandwidth WAN links and are responsible for supporting regional sales and support staff, which constitute about 60% of their workforce [doc_3]. Satellite offices, with around 250 workers, are located in strategic cities like Toronto, Dubai, Mumbai, Singapore, and Taipei, primarily supporting sales and support functions, and are connected to their respective regional hubs [doc_3]. This structure provides regional autonomy by allowing hubs to manage local operations while maintaining centralized control and management from the Paris headquarters. Additionally, the organization supports a significant portion of its workforce as mobile-only, especially in regional hubs and satellite offices, further enhancing flexibility and responsiveness across its global footprint [doc_3].",
