    "question": "How does Contoso's data classification into three levels influence its cloud security policies, particularly regarding data at rest and in transit?",
    "answer": "Contoso's data classification into three levels significantly influences its cloud security policies by tailoring security measures to the sensitivity and value of the data. For data at rest and in transit, Contoso implements specific protections based on these levels. For example, all data, regardless of level, is encrypted while stored and during transmission, ensuring data at rest and in transit is protected [doc_3]. Additionally, higher data levels, such as Level 3, require the highest encryption standards, multi-factor authentication, and granular auditing to meet regional compliance and security needs [doc_3]. The policies also specify that cloud resource access must be authenticated, leveraging multi-factor authentication where possible, and data sent across the internet must be encrypted using HTTPS, IPsec, or similar methods [doc_4]. These measures ensure that sensitive data, especially at higher classification levels, is adequately protected both at rest and in transit, aligning security practices with the data's value and sensitivity [doc_1], [doc_3], [doc_4].",
