    "question": "How does Contoso's data classification into three levels influence its choice of Microsoft cloud security features?",
    "answer": "Contoso's classification of data into three levels significantly influences its choice of Microsoft cloud security features. By categorizing data based on sensitivity\u2014such as Level 1 for general communications, Level 2 for financial and legal data, and Level 3 for sensitive customer information and proprietary data\u2014Contoso can tailor security measures to protect each level appropriately. This classification allows the company to implement specific access controls, retention policies, and information protection strategies aligned with the sensitivity of each data level, ensuring that more sensitive data receives higher security protections. This approach is supported by their review process and the detailed requirements they established for each data level, which guide the selection of suitable Microsoft cloud security features [doc_1], [doc_3], [doc_4].",

These Azure servers are configured with non-overlapping address spaces, routing, and DNS, and are managed through the cloud network, allowing for dynamic scaling, especially for end-of-quarter processing and archival storage, reducing the burden on physical hardware and enabling consistent performance across distributed locations [doc_1, doc_4].

The workplace safety program includes hazard identification and risk assessment, safety training, provision of personal protective equipment (PPE), emergency preparedness, reporting mechanisms, regular safety inspections, and record-keeping of incidents and training [doc_1]. These elements collectively aim to prevent accidents and hazards, promote safety awareness, and ensure preparedness for emergencies.\n\nThe workplace violence prevention program focuses on creating a secure environment through training on recognizing signs of violence, responding appropriately, and enforcing a zero-tolerance policy for threats, violence, or abuse [doc_2, doc_3, doc_4, doc_5]. It emphasizes reporting suspicious activities, prompt investigation of incidents, and disciplinary actions.\n\nBoth programs are interconnected in their overarching goal of safeguarding employees. The safety program's hazard assessment and emergency preparedness components support the violence prevention efforts by identifying potential risks and establishing protocols for response. Training and reporting mechanisms are common to both, fostering a culture of safety and vigilance. Together, these components form an integrated approach to maintaining a safe, respectful, and healthy workplace environment at Contoso Electronics.",
