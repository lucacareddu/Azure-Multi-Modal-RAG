    "question": "How does Contoso's data classification into three levels influence its choice of Microsoft cloud security features?",
    "answer": "Contoso's data classification into three levels significantly influences its choice of Microsoft cloud security features. For Level 1 data, which has low business value, Contoso allows broad access to all users, with data retention of 6 months and basic encryption for information protection. Level 2 data, with medium business value, restricts access to employees, subcontractors, and partners, and employs additional security measures such as MFA, TLS, and MAM, with a retention period of 2 years and hash values for data integrity. For the most sensitive Level 3 data, access is limited to executives and leads in engineering and manufacturing, with enhanced security like RMS with managed network devices, digital signatures for non-repudiation, and a retention period of 7 years [doc_4]. This tiered approach ensures that security features are appropriately aligned with the sensitivity and value of the data, optimizing protection while maintaining compliance and operational efficiency.",

According to the retrieved sources, Contoso classifies data based on sensitivity levels and applies corresponding security measures. For high-value data (Level 3), access is restricted to executives and leads in engineering and manufacturing, with the use of Rights Management Services (RMS) and managed network devices to ensure secure access [doc_4]. Additionally, for data protection, Contoso employs digital signatures for non-repudiation, and uses hash values to maintain data integrity [doc_4]. Regarding encryption, the company mandates the use of encryption for sensitive data, especially for Level 2 and Level 3 data, to prevent unauthorized access and ensure confidentiality [doc_2]. Furthermore, Contoso adheres to regional regulatory requirements, which include compliance with data storage and encryption regulations, to prevent fines and maintain good relations with local authorities [doc_5].
