    "question": "How does Contoso's data classification into three levels influence its choice of Microsoft cloud security features?",
    "answer": "Contoso's classification of data into three levels significantly influences its choice of Microsoft cloud security features. By categorizing data based on sensitivity\u2014such as Level 1 for general communications, Level 2 for financial and legal data, and Level 3 for sensitive customer and proprietary information\u2014Contoso can tailor security measures to each level's specific needs. This targeted approach ensures that more sensitive data, like Level 3, receives enhanced protection, including stricter access controls and encryption, aligning with the detailed requirements established for each data level [doc_1][doc_3][doc_4]. This strategic classification helps Contoso implement appropriate security policies and leverage Microsoft cloud offerings effectively to safeguard their most valuable data.",

    "answer": "Contoso Electronics has established comprehensive workplace safety and violence prevention programs, each comprising several key components that work together to ensure a safe and healthy environment. The workplace safety program includes hazard identification and risk assessment, safety training, provision of personal protective equipment (PPE), emergency preparedness, reporting mechanisms, safety inspections, and record keeping. These elements collectively aim to prevent accidents and hazards, promote safety awareness, and ensure compliance with safety standards [doc_1].\n\nThe workplace violence prevention program focuses on creating a secure environment through employee training on violence recognition and response, a strict zero-tolerance policy for violence, and clear procedures for reporting suspicious activities or incidents. It emphasizes prompt investigation and disciplinary actions when necessary [doc_2, doc_3, doc_4, doc_5].\n\nBoth programs are interconnected in their overarching goal of safeguarding employees. The safety program's hazard assessment and inspections help identify potential risks, including those related to violence, while training and reporting mechanisms ensure that employees are prepared and empowered to respond effectively. Together, these components foster a culture of safety and security, reinforcing each other to maintain a protected workplace environment.",
