    "question": "How does Contoso's data classification into three levels influence its cloud security policies, particularly regarding data at rest and in transit?",
    "answer": "Contoso's data classification into three levels significantly influences its cloud security policies by tailoring security measures to the value and sensitivity of the data. For data at rest, Contoso applies different encryption and access controls depending on the data level. For example, high-value data (Level 3) is protected with the highest levels of encryption, authentication, and auditing, ensuring robust security measures are in place [doc_2]. Regarding data in transit, Contoso enforces encryption protocols such as HTTPS or IPsec to secure data as it moves across networks, with stricter controls for more sensitive data [doc_5]. This tiered approach ensures that the most critical data receives the highest level of protection both at rest and during transmission, aligning security policies with data sensitivity levels [doc_1, doc_3].",
