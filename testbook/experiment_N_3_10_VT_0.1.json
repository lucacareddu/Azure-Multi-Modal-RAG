    "question": "How does Contoso's data classification into three levels influence its cloud security policies, particularly regarding data at rest and in transit?",
    "answer": "Contoso's classification of data into three levels significantly influences its cloud security policies by establishing tailored security measures for each level. For data at rest, Contoso applies the highest levels of encryption for the most sensitive data (Level 3), ensuring compliance with regional regulations and protecting proprietary information through advanced encryption techniques [doc_3]. For data in transit, the company mandates encryption methods such as HTTPS or IPsec to secure data traveling across the internet, preventing plain text transmission and unauthorized access [doc_4]. Additionally, Contoso enforces strong authentication, including multi-factor authentication, and implements least privilege access controls to safeguard data across all levels [doc_4]. These policies ensure that sensitive data, especially at higher classification levels, is protected both when stored and during transmission, aligning security measures with data sensitivity.",
