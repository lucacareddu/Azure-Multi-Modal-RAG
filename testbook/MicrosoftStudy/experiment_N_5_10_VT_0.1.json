      "Just as we saw differences across levels in change experience, a gap is also seen when we look at the perceived value that AI can provide. We know that 60% of leaders worry their organization's leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement Al1. In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\nWhat does this mean?

      "Transformation, of any kind, is all about behavioral change. The use of AI is often overlaid on top of products or processes that people are already using in their day-to-day. This means with Al transformation we're both asking people to create new habits and break old ones.\nWe talk about employee engagement as the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes. Successful AI transformation strategies will consider how a strong employee experience (EX) and an engaged workforce can serve as a foundation for and accelerant of AI adoption.\nEncouragingly, this study finds early indication that AI use does have a positive relationship with key employee experiences. Favorability on engagement, among other outcomes, increases with frequency of AI use. High frequency (at least once a day) users score highest across the employee outcomes.\nSelf-report measures of productivity-which we often think of as a key benefit of Al use-also increase with more frequent use. Interestingly, the largest experience increase across use frequency is engagement. Engagement jumps 18 percentage points from the low to moderate AI use frequency groups.\nWhile these findings are correlational in nature (not causal), it's worth taking note that Al use and engagement are not unrelated.

Only 56% of employees at typical organizations say the same.\nHPOs are providing access to organization- sponsored AI tools at a substantially higher rate than typical organizations and in turn are seeing more frequent use of AI. HPO employees are more likely to report that they understand where AI could be integrated in their work (87% at HPOs versus 67% at typical organizations) and more likely to have opportunities to integrate AI tools at work (83% at HPOs versus 56% at typical organizations).\nThis experimentation is likely fueling a virtuous loop from use to realized value, in that more experimentation leads to greater realized value and vice versa. We see that 87% of those at HPOs agree there is value in integrating AI to their workplace versus 64% of employees at typical organizations.\nExtent of organization-sponsored AI tools much higher at HPOs, which could be driving high use frequency for HPO employees\nLow frequency = A few times a month or less Moderate frequency = At least once a week High frequency = At least once a day"

      "Transformation, of any kind, is all about behavioral change. The use of AI is often overlaid on top of products or processes that people are already using in their day-to-day. This means with Al transformation we're both asking people to create new habits and break old ones.\nWe talk about employee engagement as the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes. Successful AI transformation strategies will consider how a strong employee experience (EX) and an engaged workforce can serve as a foundation for and accelerant of AI adoption.\nEncouragingly, this study finds early indication that AI use does have a positive relationship with key employee experiences. Favorability on engagement, among other outcomes, increases with frequency of AI use. High frequency (at least once a day) users score highest across the employee outcomes.\nSelf-report measures of productivity-which we often think of as a key benefit of Al use-also increase with more frequent use. Interestingly, the largest experience increase across use frequency is engagement. Engagement jumps 18 percentage points from the low to moderate AI use frequency groups.\nWhile these findings are correlational in nature (not causal), it's worth taking note that Al use and engagement are not unrelated. Building an AI transformation strategy without considering EX would miss a potential propellant of adoption success.",
      "Work transformations of any kind don't happen in a vacuum. AI transformation will consist of many changes in the sea of other organizational change that your people are going through. People already having a negative employee experience are likely to struggle even more throughout change.\nIn this study, we found that although most employees find the pace of change at their organization to be just right, stress and strain are still present. Meaning even in the best of conditions, change is hard. This stress and strain related to change can be an indicator of burnout. Through self-report on seven risk factors of burnout (e.g., overwhelming workload,\ndisconnection from colleagues, unclear responsibilities), we found those who have experienced three or more burnout risk factors in the previous month had substantially higher stress and strain and substantially lower confidence they could keep up during change.\nFor AI transformation specifically, while AI tooling can be part of the solution (e.g., helping with faster task completion and productivity), we first need to create the time and environment that allows employees to shift their behavior and begin to utilize AI in this way. Consider the change saturation, time demands, and experience of employees during change, not just the technical elements of rollout.\nWhen organizations approach change thoughtfully in terms of supporting their people with upskilling and learning, proactively addressing concerns, and collecting ongoing feedback, they set up better conditions for sustainable change. This becomes even more critical with longer-term transformation versus smaller change initiatives.",

      "we can tell from our study, is this lack of organization-sponsored Al investment isn't due to a lack of value placed on how AI can transform organizations.\nMost senior-level leaders have high support for AI transformation. In fact, 78% of executives believe AI is critical for their organization to succeed and worth the investment of money, time, and effort. This indicates potential for organizational investments in AI tools and integrations in the future.\nDespite support, leaders indicate concern with the time it takes for transformation. About two thirds of executives believe adopting AI will take more time and effort than other technologies. While we agree that full AI transformation won't happen overnight, organization-sponsored rollouts and change efforts can take advantage of the employee energy for AI use to get started on their AI transformation.\nIn Microsoft HR, a key step in AI transformation has been capturing the energy and momentum and channeling them in a way that would continue to stoke the creative spark that was ignited across the organization. As a result, we harnessed ideas while driving for measurable results and encouraging cross-group collaboration in the adoption of technology.\"\nIn most organizational change, the first hurdle is building excitement and buy-in. When it comes to AI, people are already using the technology, reducing the need to build energy. It's to organizations' advantage to harness this existing energy and guide it toward AI use- cases and strategic applications that will be beneficial to individuals and the organization.\nAI transformation undoubtedly presents unique challenges but having an existing group of users excited about using AI, already experimenting with AI in their work, and wanting to share learnings with others is a leg up that many change initiatives do not have the benefit of. Use this excitement as a springboard into AI transformation."

Explore different AI use-cases, key performance indictors, and potential benefits of AI use by role. Consider this a jump-start to thoughtful implementation and continue to iterate and co-create additional scenarios with your people. Have employees test, provide feedback, and generate new ideas that surface as they use AI in their work.\nExperimentation can take many forms, varying on level of structure (informal versus organized) and relatedness to a particular role (general versus specific). Use a mix of experimentation methods, consider what methods have been successful in the past and how multiple methods may work together. Informal, general testing can be useful as people are getting used to AI at work.

      "The connection between engaged employees and better business performance3 is well- established. In this study, we see engagement is not only related to use frequency, but also support for and value derived from AI.\nUltimately, engaged employees are more supportive of AI integration in their workplace and are eager to contribute to the success of the transformation. Engaged employees are also reporting more positive outcomes of AI adoption. We call this set of outcomes RIVA, or Realized Individual Value of AI. RIVA encapsulates a myriad of ways that an employee might see a direct impact of AI use on their day- to-day, such as completing tasks faster or reducing work-related stress.\nEngaged employees are 2.6x as likely to say they fully support AI integration and are eager to contribute to AI transformation success\nWhen we think of all the ways AI can support an employee, those who are already engaged are findings ways to capitalize on that value. Engaged employees have higher RIVA, with scores averaging 19 percentage points higher, even when controlling for high frequency use.\nWhen an employee's RIVA is high, it indicates success in translating their AI use into tangible benefits, which may be spurring even more use of the tool. Thirty-four percent of engaged employees are high frequency users versus only 12% of non-engaged employees. We hypothesize that the more benefits users see, the more likely they are to be motivated and inspired to continue leveraging AI, leading to a virtuous cycle between ongoing use and realized value of AI.",
      "Just as we saw differences across levels in change experience, a gap is also seen when we look at the perceived value that AI can provide. We know that 60% of leaders worry their organization's leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement Al1. In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\nWhat does this mean? Typical organizations are struggling to help individual contributors connect the dots between micro-value (how AI helps me individually) to macro-value (how AI helps my organization). HPOs are further along.",

    "question": "How does the study suggest organizations can leverage their existing employee energy and excitement around AI to accelerate transformation?",
    "answer": "The study suggests that organizations can leverage existing employee energy and excitement around AI by harnessing this momentum to initiate and accelerate AI transformation efforts. Specifically, organizations should channel this enthusiasm into strategic AI use cases and applications that benefit both individuals and the organization. Microsoft HR's approach, as highlighted in the study, involves capturing and directing employee energy and momentum, encouraging cross-group collaboration, and focusing on measurable results. This proactive engagement helps to build on the initial excitement and sustain momentum throughout the AI transformation process, turning employee enthusiasm into a driving force for change [doc_1].",

      "Transformation, of any kind, is all about behavioral change. The use of AI is often overlaid on top of products or processes that people are already using in their day-to-day. This means with Al transformation we're both asking people to create new habits and break old ones.\nWe talk about employee engagement as the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes. Successful AI transformation strategies will consider how a strong employee experience (EX) and an engaged workforce can serve as a foundation for and accelerant of AI adoption.\nEncouragingly, this study finds early indication that AI use does have a positive relationship with key employee experiences. Favorability on engagement, among other outcomes, increases with frequency of AI use. High frequency (at least once a day) users score highest across the employee outcomes.\nSelf-report measures of productivity-which we often think of as a key benefit of Al use-also increase with more frequent use. Interestingly, the largest experience increase across use frequency is engagement. Engagement jumps 18 percentage points from the low to moderate AI use frequency groups.\nWhile these findings are correlational in nature (not causal), it's worth taking note that Al use and engagement are not unrelated. Building an AI transformation strategy without considering EX would miss a potential propellant of adoption success.",
      "People throughout history have always been innovators, but we often create tools faster than we can adapt our behaviors and shift our practices. With the exponential growth of AI capabilities in the past few years, we are at a point where the shift to an AI-powered workplace is not just about the tools available, but also how people are shifting their work habits and behaviors.\nWhile excitement for Al is evident in the rapid-and growing1-use of Al tools at work, many organizations have not fully integrated these tools in formal, organization-sponsored rollouts. As leaders consider enterprise investments in AI, a new question emerges: are people ready for this large-scale AI transformation? And more importantly, how can we best prepare for this shift in how we work to get the most value from the promises of AI?\nThis eBook outlines findings from a Microsoft Viva People Science study on AI readiness, discusses implications, and provides practical guidance for leaders and HR on how they can best support people through change related to AI at work.",

      "Work transformations of any kind don't happen in a vacuum. AI transformation will consist of many changes in the sea of other organizational change that your people are going through. People already having a negative employee experience are likely to struggle even more throughout change.\nIn this study, we found that although most employees find the pace of change at their organization to be just right, stress and strain are still present. Meaning even in the best of conditions, change is hard. This stress and strain related to change can be an indicator of burnout. Through self-report on seven risk factors of burnout (e.g., overwhelming workload,\ndisconnection from colleagues, unclear responsibilities), we found those who have experienced three or more burnout risk factors in the previous month had substantially higher stress and strain and substantially lower confidence they could keep up during change.\nFor AI transformation specifically, while AI tooling can be part of the solution (e.g., helping with faster task completion and productivity), we first need to create the time and environment that allows employees to shift their behavior and begin to utilize AI in this way. Consider the change saturation, time demands, and experience of employees during change, not just the technical elements of rollout.\nWhen organizations approach change thoughtfully in terms of supporting their people with upskilling and learning, proactively addressing concerns, and collecting ongoing feedback, they set up better conditions for sustainable change. This becomes even more critical with longer-term transformation versus smaller change initiatives.",
