Yet individual contributors have far more skepticism:\n. Only 56% of individual contributors say they trust the output of AI versus 82% of leaders and 71% of managers.\n. Only 47% of individual contributors agree that AI will transform work for the better versus 84% of leaders and 69% of managers.\nTop concerns across all levels and profiles include:\n1. Security and data privacy.\n2. , Over-reliance on Al for automatic decision making, particularly those decisions that have impact on employees (e.g., hiring).\n3. Potential job loss or deskilling due to AI taking over tasks traditionally done by humans.\nAddressing the concerns for your people is an important part of managing potential change resistance. To do this, uncover what the top concerns are for your organization through ongoing feedback mechanisms. Communicate what security efforts are in place to ensure the safety and accuracy of AI use. Provide skilling where AI has been integrated, both reskilling where there may be automation, and upskilling where AI may shift a workflow. As you begin to rollout AI, share success stories and quick wins.\nFear around AI may be driven by the unknown. Exposure can be helpful in reducing apprehension even for AI skeptics or people who do not feel tech savvy. Don't discount the value of surfacing concerns, this builds trust that key risks are not being overlooked and helps refine and improve your AI strategy."
