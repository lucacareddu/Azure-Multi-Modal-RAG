      "Just as we saw differences across levels in change experience, a gap is also seen when we look at the perceived value that AI can provide. We know that 60% of leaders worry their organization's leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement Al1. In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\nWhat does this mean?

      "HPOs provide far more access to AI tools than typical organizations, with 48% from HPOs versus 26% from typical organizations saying all AI tools they use are provided by their organization. This creates space for more use and organization-supported experimentation. Experimentation can be highly valuable in uncovering AI use-cases and scenarios that drive value for individuals, teams, and the organization.\nAs you consider the most impactful AI use-cases for your organization, remember AI is not a one- size-fits all solution and can be tailored to unique needs. Often, this means different functions and\nroles find differing value across the variety of AI capabilities available.\nUse the Microsoft Copilot Scenario Library to start your experimentation journey. Explore different AI use-cases, key performance indictors, and potential benefits of AI use by role. Consider this a jump-start to thoughtful implementation and continue to iterate and co-create additional scenarios with your people. Have employees test, provide feedback, and generate new ideas that surface as they use AI in their work.\nExperimentation can take many forms, varying on level of structure (informal versus organized) and relatedness to a particular role (general versus specific). Use a mix of experimentation methods, consider what methods have been successful in the past and how multiple methods may work together. Informal, general testing can be useful as people are getting used to AI at work. Organized and specific testing is necessary as substantial AI investments and systemic workflow integrations are made.",

In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap.

      "The connection between engaged employees and better business performance3 is well- established.

Engaged employees are also reporting more positive outcomes of AI adoption. We call this set of outcomes RIVA, or Realized Individual Value of AI. RIVA encapsulates a myriad of ways that an employee might see a direct impact of AI use on their day- to-day, such as completing tasks faster or reducing work-related stress.\nEngaged employees are 2.6x as likely to say they fully support AI integration and are eager to contribute to AI transformation success\nWhen we think of all the ways AI can support an employee, those who are already engaged are findings ways to capitalize on that value. Engaged employees have higher RIVA, with scores averaging 19 percentage points higher, even when controlling for high frequency use.\nWhen an employee's RIVA is high, it indicates success in translating their AI use into tangible benefits, which may be spurring even more use of the tool. Thirty-four percent of engaged employees are high frequency users versus only 12% of non-engaged employees. We hypothesize that the more benefits users see, the more likely they are to be motivated and inspired to continue leveraging AI, leading to a virtuous cycle between ongoing use and realized value of AI.",

In comparison, employees at typical organizations are less likely to hold this belief, indicating a significant positive perception of AI's role in employer branding at HPOs [doc_1].",

      "A bar chart comparing perceptions of AI's organizational value among roles in HPOs and typical organizations. At HPOs, 91% of leaders, 63% of managers, and 54% of individual contributors believe AI is effective. In typical organizations, these figures are 65% for leaders, 51% for managers, and 24% for individual contributors. The chart highlights that individual contributors at HPOs are significantly more likely to see AI as valuable compared to their counterparts in typical organizations.",
      "The bar chart compares high-performing organizations (HPOs) and typical organizations regarding AI tool provision and usage frequency. 48% of HPOs provide many AI tools, compared to 26% of typical organizations. Both groups mostly provide a moderate number of tools (27% HPO, 31% typical), while 19% HPOs and 32% typical organizations provide only a few, and 6% HPOs versus 9% typical organizations provide none. Regarding usage, 47% of HPO employees use AI tools daily, against 22% in typical organizations, with 29% HPOs and 30% typical organizations using tools moderately. Rare use occurs in 13% of HPOs and 26% of typical organizations, while 10% of HPO employees and 20% of typical employees never use AI tools.",
      "Employees at HPOs report more positive change experiences than those at typical organizations across the board. When we look at which experiences have the largest differences between HPOs and typical organizations, we see common themes that center around the human experience. HPOs approach change with a more people-centric focus, ensuring support, respect, and inclusion.\nEmployees at HPOs more often felt considered and respected during negative change moments, felt included in decisions, and felt that their management was receptive to feedback.\nEmployees at HPOs are 60% more likely to feel included in decisions about change that will impact their jobs.\nKnowing great change experience is critical to AI readiness, it is not surprising that we also see HPOs scoring higher on RIVA.\nWhat we can learn from HPOs is that moving from a 'good' to 'great' change experience is all about how we prioritize the individuals going through the change and support them during the process. Leaning into fundamental people-centric change experiences can set an organization up for success when tackling an AI transformation. Due to the positive experiences that HPO employees have already had with change - they are primed and ready to go for an AI-driven future."
