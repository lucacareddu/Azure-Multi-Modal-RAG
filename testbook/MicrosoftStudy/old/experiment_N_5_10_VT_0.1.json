      "Just as we saw differences across levels in change experience, a gap is also seen when we look at the perceived value that AI can provide.

In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\nWhat does this mean?

Consider this a jump-start to thoughtful implementation and continue to iterate and co-create additional scenarios with your people. Have employees test, provide feedback, and generate new ideas that surface as they use AI in their work.\nExperimentation can take many forms, varying on level of structure (informal versus organized) and relatedness to a particular role (general versus specific). Use a mix of experimentation methods, consider what methods have been successful in the past and how multiple methods may work together.

      "Just as we saw differences across levels in change experience, a gap is also seen when we look at the perceived value that AI can provide. We know that 60% of leaders worry their organization's leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement Al1. In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\nWhat does this mean?

Explore different AI use-cases, key performance indictors, and potential benefits of AI use by role. Consider this a jump-start to thoughtful implementation and continue to iterate and co-create additional scenarios with your people. Have employees test, provide feedback, and generate new ideas that surface as they use AI in their work.\nExperimentation can take many forms, varying on level of structure (informal versus organized) and relatedness to a particular role (general versus specific). Use a mix of experimentation methods, consider what methods have been successful in the past and how multiple methods may work together. Informal, general testing can be useful as people are getting used to AI at work.

Explore different AI use-cases, key performance indictors, and potential benefits of AI use by role. Consider this a jump-start to thoughtful implementation and continue to iterate and co-create additional scenarios with your people. Have employees test, provide feedback, and generate new ideas that surface as they use AI in their work.\nExperimentation can take many forms, varying on level of structure (informal versus organized) and relatedness to a particular role (general versus specific). Use a mix of experimentation methods, consider what methods have been successful in the past and how multiple methods may work together.

In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\nWhat does this mean?

The HPO category includes those who indicated that a majority of the performance indicators were 'always' demonstrated (17% of respondents).\nCompared to those at typical organizations, people at HPOs see more value in bringing AI to their organization. They are substantially more likely to say they fully support the integration of AI at their workplace and are eager to contribute to the success of the transformation.\nWhat do HPOs do differently?

Share feedback with those who are in the best position to make meaningful adjustments throughout change.\nHPOs celebrate milestones and achievements recognizing employees' efforts and contributions to the change. Sharing success stories is a great way to do this. Showcase both smooth paths to success, as well as stories about teams who ran into barriers and how they met their challenges with resilience.\nHPOs also provide empathy and support during change. Recognizing that change can be stressful, HPOs do not dismiss the emotions of their people, but rather anticipate concerns and provide relevant support.\nIn AI transformation: Help employees see their part in AI transformation and clarify how their role may shift (and stay the same) in the future. Reduce uncertainty and acknowledge where there are unknowns.

This may cause employee hesitance to share with their peers and leaders how they are using AI in their day-to-day.\nEncouraging Al experimentation-the testing and sharing of what worked and what didn't - provides highly useful information, uncovering valuable AI use-cases across roles.\nUnderstanding the most impactful way to use AI helps move from an aspirational AI vision to one that is tangible, already tested, and rooted in the real experiences of your employees. Providing access to AI tools creates an atmosphere that will encourage more experimentation, frequent use, and the sharing of experiences.\n83% of employees at HPOs say they have opportunities to integrate AI into their work. Only 56% of employees at typical organizations say the same.\nHPOs are providing access to organization- sponsored AI tools at a substantially higher rate than typical organizations and in turn are seeing more frequent use of AI.

      "The connection between engaged employees and better business performance3 is well- established. In this study, we see engagement is not only related to use frequency, but also support for and value derived from AI.\nUltimately, engaged employees are more supportive of AI integration in their workplace and are eager to contribute to the success of the transformation. Engaged employees are also reporting more positive outcomes of AI adoption. We call this set of outcomes RIVA, or Realized Individual Value of AI. RIVA encapsulates a myriad of ways that an employee might see a direct impact of AI use on their day- to-day, such as completing tasks faster or reducing work-related stress.\nEngaged employees are 2.6x as likely to say they fully support AI integration and are eager to contribute to AI transformation success\nWhen we think of all the ways AI can support an employee, those who are already engaged are findings ways to capitalize on that value. Engaged employees have higher RIVA, with scores averaging 19 percentage points higher, even when controlling for high frequency use.\nWhen an employee's RIVA is high, it indicates success in translating their AI use into tangible benefits, which may be spurring even more use of the tool. Thirty-four percent of engaged employees are high frequency users versus only 12% of non-engaged employees. We hypothesize that the more benefits users see, the more likely they are to be motivated and inspired to continue leveraging AI, leading to a virtuous cycle between ongoing use and realized value of AI.",

Potential job loss or deskilling due to AI taking over tasks traditionally done by humans.\nAddressing the concerns for your people is an important part of managing potential change resistance. To do this, uncover what the top concerns are for your organization through ongoing feedback mechanisms. Communicate what security efforts are in place to ensure the safety and accuracy of AI use. Provide skilling where AI has been integrated, both reskilling where there may be automation, and upskilling where AI may shift a workflow. As you begin to rollout AI, share success stories and quick wins.\nFear around AI may be driven by the unknown. Exposure can be helpful in reducing apprehension even for AI skeptics or people who do not feel tech savvy.

We see that 87% of those at HPOs agree there is value in integrating AI to their workplace versus 64% of employees at typical organizations.\nExtent of organization-sponsored AI tools much higher at HPOs, which could be driving high use frequency for HPO employees\nAmount of AI tools provided by their organization\nAll\n48%\n26%\nMost\n27%\n31%\nSome\n19%\n32%\nNone\n6%\n9%\nHPO\nTypical organization\nFrequency of AI tool use\nHigh\n47%\n22%\nMod\n29%\n30%\nLow\n13%\n26%\nNever\n10%\n20%\nHPO\nTypical organization\nLow frequency = A few times a month or less Moderate frequency = At least once a week High frequency = At least once a day"

      "High Performing Organizations (HPOs)4 continuously exceed expectations in areas ranging from financial performance to employee engagement. There are three pillars that work together to characterize high performance at these organizations: engaged employees, productive teams, and resilient business.\nThose at HPOs are 90% more likely to say they fully support AI being integrated in their workplace.\nRespondents at HPOs were identified based on how often they reported their organization demonstrated a set of key performance indicators. The HPO category includes those who indicated that a majority of the performance indicators were 'always' demonstrated (17% of respondents).\nCompared to those at typical organizations, people at HPOs see more value in bringing AI to their organization. They are substantially more likely to say they fully support the integration of AI at their workplace and are eager to contribute to the success of the transformation.\nWhat do HPOs do differently? We see key differences about how they approach change, bring people along with the AI vision, and provide access to AI tools. We unpack these areas and what this means for leaders as we go into the era of AI.\nEmployees at HPOs see the value AI can bring to their organizations.\n70%\n70% more likely to say AI is critical for their organization to be successful\n80%\n80% more likely to say AI will distinguish their organization as an employer of choice\n70%\n70% more likely to say AI will boost their organization's revenue and financial success\nMore likely compared to employees at typical organizations"
