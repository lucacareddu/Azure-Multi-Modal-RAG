      "The connection between engaged employees and better business performance3 is well- established. In this study, we see engagement is not only related to use frequency, but also support for and value derived from AI.\nUltimately, engaged employees are more supportive of AI integration in their workplace and are eager to contribute to the success of the transformation. Engaged employees are also reporting more positive outcomes of AI adoption. We call this set of outcomes RIVA, or Realized Individual Value of AI. RIVA encapsulates a myriad of ways that an employee might see a direct impact of AI use on their day- to-day, such as completing tasks faster or reducing work-related stress.\nEngaged employees are 2.6x as likely to say they fully support AI integration and are eager to contribute to AI transformation success\nWhen we think of all the ways AI can support an employee, those who are already engaged are findings ways to capitalize on that value. Engaged employees have higher RIVA, with scores averaging 19 percentage points higher, even when controlling for high frequency use.\nWhen an employee's RIVA is high, it indicates success in translating their AI use into tangible benefits, which may be spurring even more use of the tool. Thirty-four percent of engaged employees are high frequency users versus only 12% of non-engaged employees. We hypothesize that the more benefits users see, the more likely they are to be motivated and inspired to continue leveraging AI, leading to a virtuous cycle between ongoing use and realized value of AI.",
      "The bar chart illustrates that higher AI usage frequency is associated with more favorable employee experiences across metrics. Percentages of respondents with positive responses increase with AI use: Engagement (95% at high frequency), Recommend (89%), Retention (91%), Individual productivity (93%), and Team productivity (84%). The data compares four AI use levels: Never, Low frequency (a few times a month or less), Moderate frequency (at least once a week), and High frequency (at least once a day)."

Providing access to AI tools creates an atmosphere that will encourage more experimentation, frequent use, and the sharing of experiences.\n83% of employees at HPOs say they have opportunities to integrate AI into their work. Only 56% of employees at typical organizations say the same.\nHPOs are providing access to organization- sponsored AI tools at a substantially higher rate than typical organizations and in turn are seeing more frequent use of AI. HPO employees are more likely to report that they understand where AI could be integrated in their work (87% at HPOs versus 67% at typical organizations) and more likely to have opportunities to integrate AI tools at work (83% at HPOs versus 56% at typical organizations).\nThis experimentation is likely fueling a virtuous loop from use to realized value, in that more experimentation leads to greater realized value and vice versa. We see that 87% of those at HPOs agree there is value in integrating AI to their workplace versus 64% of employees at typical organizations.\nExtent of organization-sponsored AI tools much higher at HPOs, which could be driving high use frequency for HPO employees\nLow frequency = A few times a month or less Moderate frequency = At least once a week High frequency = At least once a day"

In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\nWhat does this mean? Typical organizations are struggling to help individual contributors connect the dots between micro-value (how AI helps me individually) to macro-value (how AI helps my organization).

This indicates potential for organizational investments in AI tools and integrations in the future.\nDespite support, leaders indicate concern with the time it takes for transformation. About two thirds of executives believe adopting AI will take more time and effort than other technologies. While we agree that full AI transformation won't happen overnight, organization-sponsored rollouts and change efforts can take advantage of the employee energy for AI use to get started on their AI transformation.\nIn Microsoft HR, a key step in AI transformation has been capturing the energy and momentum and channeling them in a way that would continue to stoke the creative spark that was ignited across the organization. As a result, we harnessed ideas while driving for measurable results and encouraging cross-group collaboration in the adoption of technology.\"\nIn most organizational change, the first hurdle is building excitement and buy-in. When it comes to AI, people are already using the technology, reducing the need to build energy. It's to organizations' advantage to harness this existing energy and guide it toward AI use- cases and strategic applications that will be beneficial to individuals and the organization.\nAI transformation undoubtedly presents unique challenges but having an existing group of users excited about using AI, already experimenting with AI in their work, and wanting to share learnings with others is a leg up that many change initiatives do not have the benefit of.
