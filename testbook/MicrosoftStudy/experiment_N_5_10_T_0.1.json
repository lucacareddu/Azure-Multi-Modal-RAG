    "question": "What percentage of employees at High Performing Organizations (HPOs) report that all AI tools they use are provided by their organization, and how does this compare to typical organizations?",
    "answer": "The data indicates that 83% of employees at High Performing Organizations (HPOs) report having opportunities to integrate AI into their work, and a significant portion of these employees are provided with organization-sponsored AI tools. Specifically, the extent of organization-sponsored AI tools is much higher at HPOs, which correlates with higher usage frequency and more experimentation with AI. In contrast, at typical organizations, only 56% of employees report having opportunities to integrate AI, and fewer are provided with organization-sponsored AI tools. While the exact percentage of employees at HPOs who report that all AI tools they use are provided by their organization is not explicitly stated, the high level of access and experimentation suggests a substantial majority, likely around or above 80%. This is notably higher compared to typical organizations, where a smaller proportion of employees have such access, reflecting a more strategic and supported AI environment at HPOs [doc_3].",

This means with Al transformation we're both asking people to create new habits and break old ones.\nWe talk about employee engagement as the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes. Successful AI transformation strategies will consider how a strong employee experience (EX) and an engaged workforce can serve as a foundation for and accelerant of AI adoption.\nEncouragingly, this study finds early indication that AI use does have a positive relationship with key employee experiences. Favorability on engagement, among other outcomes, increases with frequency of AI use. High frequency (at least once a day) users score highest across the employee outcomes.\nSelf-report measures of productivity-which we often think of as a key benefit of Al use-also increase with more frequent use. Interestingly, the largest experience increase across use frequency is engagement. Engagement jumps 18 percentage points from the low to moderate AI use frequency groups.\nWhile these findings are correlational in nature (not causal), it's worth taking note that Al use and engagement are not unrelated.

This may cause employee hesitance to share with their peers and leaders how they are using AI in their day-to-day.\nEncouraging Al experimentation-the testing and sharing of what worked and what didn't - provides highly useful information, uncovering valuable AI use-cases across roles.\nUnderstanding the most impactful way to use AI helps move from an aspirational AI vision to one that is tangible, already tested, and rooted in the real experiences of your employees. Providing access to AI tools creates an atmosphere that will encourage more experimentation, frequent use, and the sharing of experiences.\n83% of employees at HPOs say they have opportunities to integrate AI into their work. Only 56% of employees at typical organizations say the same.\nHPOs are providing access to organization- sponsored AI tools at a substantially higher rate than typical organizations and in turn are seeing more frequent use of AI.

      "Work transformations of any kind don't happen in a vacuum. AI transformation will consist of many changes in the sea of other organizational change that your people are going through. People already having a negative employee experience are likely to struggle even more throughout change.\nIn this study, we found that although most employees find the pace of change at their organization to be just right, stress and strain are still present. Meaning even in the best of conditions, change is hard. This stress and strain related to change can be an indicator of burnout. Through self-report on seven risk factors of burnout (e.g., overwhelming workload,\ndisconnection from colleagues, unclear responsibilities), we found those who have experienced three or more burnout risk factors in the previous month had substantially higher stress and strain and substantially lower confidence they could keep up during change.\nFor AI transformation specifically, while AI tooling can be part of the solution (e.g., helping with faster task completion and productivity), we first need to create the time and environment that allows employees to shift their behavior and begin to utilize AI in this way. Consider the change saturation, time demands, and experience of employees during change, not just the technical elements of rollout.\nWhen organizations approach change thoughtfully in terms of supporting their people with upskilling and learning, proactively addressing concerns, and collecting ongoing feedback, they set up better conditions for sustainable change. This becomes even more critical with longer-term transformation versus smaller change initiatives.",

With the exponential growth of AI capabilities in the past few years, we are at a point where the shift to an AI-powered workplace is not just about the tools available, but also how people are shifting their work habits and behaviors.\nWhile excitement for Al is evident in the rapid-and growing1-use of Al tools at work, many organizations have not fully integrated these tools in formal, organization-sponsored rollouts. As leaders consider enterprise investments in AI, a new question emerges: are people ready for this large-scale AI transformation? And more importantly, how can we best prepare for this shift in how we work to get the most value from the promises of AI?\nThis eBook outlines findings from a Microsoft Viva People Science study on AI readiness, discusses implications, and provides practical guidance for leaders and HR on how they can best support people through change related to AI at work.",

In fact, 78% of executives believe AI is critical for their organization to succeed and worth the investment of money, time, and effort. This indicates potential for organizational investments in AI tools and integrations in the future.\nDespite support, leaders indicate concern with the time it takes for transformation. About two thirds of executives believe adopting AI will take more time and effort than other technologies. While we agree that full AI transformation won't happen overnight, organization-sponsored rollouts and change efforts can take advantage of the employee energy for AI use to get started on their AI transformation.\nIn Microsoft HR, a key step in AI transformation has been capturing the energy and momentum and channeling them in a way that would continue to stoke the creative spark that was ignited across the organization. As a result, we harnessed ideas while driving for measurable results and encouraging cross-group collaboration in the adoption of technology.\"\nIn most organizational change, the first hurdle is building excitement and buy-in. When it comes to AI, people are already using the technology, reducing the need to build energy. It's to organizations' advantage to harness this existing energy and guide it toward AI use- cases and strategic applications that will be beneficial to individuals and the organization.\nAI transformation undoubtedly presents unique challenges but having an existing group of users excited about using AI, already experimenting with AI in their work, and wanting to share learnings with others is a leg up that many change initiatives do not have the benefit of. Use this excitement as a springboard into AI transformation."

      "we can tell from our study, is this lack of organization-sponsored Al investment isn't due to a lack of value placed on how AI can transform organizations.\nMost senior-level leaders have high support for AI transformation. In fact, 78% of executives believe AI is critical for their organization to succeed and worth the investment of money, time, and effort. This indicates potential for organizational investments in AI tools and integrations in the future.\nDespite support, leaders indicate concern with the time it takes for transformation. About two thirds of executives believe adopting AI will take more time and effort than other technologies. While we agree that full AI transformation won't happen overnight, organization-sponsored rollouts and change efforts can take advantage of the employee energy for AI use to get started on their AI transformation.\nIn Microsoft HR, a key step in AI transformation has been capturing the energy and momentum and channeling them in a way that would continue to stoke the creative spark that was ignited across the organization. As a result, we harnessed ideas while driving for measurable results and encouraging cross-group collaboration in the adoption of technology.\"\nIn most organizational change, the first hurdle is building excitement and buy-in. When it comes to AI, people are already using the technology, reducing the need to build energy. It's to organizations' advantage to harness this existing energy and guide it toward AI use- cases and strategic applications that will be beneficial to individuals and the organization.\nAI transformation undoubtedly presents unique challenges but having an existing group of users excited about using AI, already experimenting with AI in their work, and wanting to share learnings with others is a leg up that many change initiatives do not have the benefit of. Use this excitement as a springboard into AI transformation.",

      "Even if you are not yet embarking on an AI transformation, now is the time to build strong change habits. As we look at AI readiness, up to 43% of how AI-ready an individual is can be explained by their previous experience with change *. This strong relationship means the positive change experience you build today will set you up for success in the future.\nIn looking at current change experience, we see an opportunity for better support at the individual contributor level. Across a variety of factors, leaders are having a substantially\ndifferent experience compared to individual contributors. Leaders who've had positive change experience in the past, may be at risk of underestimating the support their people need during change in the future. Leaders concluding people are more change-ready than they are can result in the skipping of the critical change steps of communications, skilling, and measurement. This risk of assumed alignment is amplified when there is no mechanism for employee feedback.\nTake stock of your current change management capabilities and opportunities for improvement. Build, buy, or borrow where you have gaps to ensure quality change experiences that can directly improve how employees feel as you begin to integrate AI. Focusing on change best practices will pay dividends when it comes to participation, adoption, and ultimately the success of your AI rollout."

      "Just as we saw differences across levels in change experience, a gap is also seen when we look at the perceived value that AI can provide. We know that 60% of leaders worry their organization's leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement Al1. In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals.

Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\nWhat does this mean?

      "Transformation, of any kind, is all about behavioral change. The use of AI is often overlaid on top of products or processes that people are already using in their day-to-day. This means with Al transformation we're both asking people to create new habits and break old ones.\nWe talk about employee engagement as the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes. Successful AI transformation strategies will consider how a strong employee experience (EX) and an engaged workforce can serve as a foundation for and accelerant of AI adoption.\nEncouragingly, this study finds early indication that AI use does have a positive relationship with key employee experiences. Favorability on engagement, among other outcomes, increases with frequency of AI use. High frequency (at least once a day) users score highest across the employee outcomes.\nSelf-report measures of productivity-which we often think of as a key benefit of Al use-also increase with more frequent use. Interestingly, the largest experience increase across use frequency is engagement. Engagement jumps 18 percentage points from the low to moderate AI use frequency groups.\nWhile these findings are correlational in nature (not causal), it's worth taking note that Al use and engagement are not unrelated. Building an AI transformation strategy without considering EX would miss a potential propellant of adoption success.",
