Both groups mostly provide a moderate number of tools (27% HPO, 31% typical), while 19% HPOs and 32% typical organizations provide only a few, and 6% HPOs versus 9% typical organizations provide none. Regarding usage, 47% of HPO employees use AI tools daily, against 22% in typical organizations, with 29% HPOs and 30% typical organizations using tools moderately. Rare use occurs in 13% of HPOs and 26% of typical organizations, while 10% of HPO employees and 20% of typical employees never use AI tools.", "Just as we saw differences across levels in change experience, a gap is also seen when we look at the perceived value that AI can provide. We know that 60% of leaders worry their organization's leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement Al1. In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\nWhat does this mean? Typical organizations are struggling to help individual contributors connect the dots between micro-value (how AI helps me individually) to macro-value (how AI helps my organization). HPOs are further along.", "A bar chart comparing perceptions of AI's organizational value among roles in HPOs and typical organizations. At HPOs, 91% of leaders, 63% of managers, and 54% of individual contributors believe AI is effective. In typical organizations, these figures are 65% for leaders, 51% for managers, and 24% for individual contributors. The chart highlights that individual contributors at HPOs are significantly more likely to see AI as valuable compared to their counterparts in typical organizations.", "Despite the prevalence of AI tools at work, the majority of people are using at least some tools that have not been provided directly by their organization. This may cause employee hesitance to share with their peers and leaders how they are using AI in their day-to-day.\nEncouraging Al experimentation-the testing and sharing of what worked and what didn't - provides highly useful information, uncovering valuable AI use-cases across roles.\nUnderstanding the most impactful way to use AI helps move from an aspirational AI vision to one that is tangible, already tested, and rooted in the real experiences of your employees. Providing access to AI tools creates an atmosphere that will encourage more experimentation, frequent use, and the sharing of experiences.\n83% of employees at HPOs say they have opportunities to integrate AI into their work. Only 56% of employees at typical organizations say the same.\nHPOs are providing access to organization- sponsored AI tools at a substantially higher rate than typical organizations and in turn are seeing more frequent use of AI. HPO employees are more likely to report that they understand where AI could be integrated in their work (87% at HPOs versus 67% at typical organizations) and more likely to have opportunities to integrate AI tools at work (83% at HPOs versus 56% at typical organizations).\nThis experimentation is likely fueling a virtuous loop from use to realized value, in that more experimentation leads to greater realized value and vice versa.
