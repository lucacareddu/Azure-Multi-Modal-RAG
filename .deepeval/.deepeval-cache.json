Providing access to AI tools creates an atmosphere that will encourage more experimentation, frequent use, and the sharing of experiences.\\n83% of employees at HPOs say they have opportunities to integrate AI into their work. Only 56% of employees at typical organizations say the same.\\nHPOs are providing access to organization- sponsored AI tools at a substantially higher rate than typical organizations and in turn are seeing more frequent use of AI. HPO employees are more likely to report that they understand where AI could be integrated in their work (87% at HPOs versus 67% at typical organizations) and more likely to have opportunities to integrate AI tools at work (83% at HPOs versus 56% at typical organizations).\\nThis experimentation is likely fueling a virtuous loop from use to realized value, in that more experimentation leads to greater realized value and vice versa.

In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\\nWhat does this mean?

Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap.

There are three pillars that work together to characterize high performance at these organizations: engaged employees, productive teams, and resilient business.\\nThose at HPOs are 90% more likely to say they fully support AI being integrated in their workplace.\\nRespondents at HPOs were identified based on how often they reported their organization demonstrated a set of key performance indicators. The HPO category includes those who indicated that a majority of the performance indicators were 'always' demonstrated (17% of respondents).\\nCompared to those at typical organizations, people at HPOs see more value in bringing AI to their organization. They are substantially more likely to say they fully support the integration of AI at their workplace and are eager to contribute to the success of the transformation.\\nWhat do HPOs do differently?

In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\\nWhat does this mean?

We see that 87% of those at HPOs agree there is value in integrating AI to their workplace versus 64% of employees at typical organizations.\\nExtent of organization-sponsored AI tools much higher at HPOs, which could be driving high use frequency for HPO employees\\nAmount of AI tools provided by their organization\\nAll\\n48%\\n26%\\nMost\\n27%\\n31%\\nSome\\n19%\\n32%\\nNone\\n6%\\n9%\\nHPO\\nTypical organization\\nFrequency of AI tool use\\nHigh\\n47%\\n22%\\nMod\\n29%\\n30%\\nLow\\n13%\\n26%\\nNever\\n10%\\n20%\\nHPO\\nTypical organization\\nLow frequency = A few times a month or less Moderate frequency = At least once a week High frequency = At least once a day\", \"High Performing Organizations (HPOs)4 continuously exceed expectations in areas ranging from financial performance to employee engagement.

They are substantially more likely to say they fully support the integration of AI at their workplace and are eager to contribute to the success of the transformation.\\nWhat do HPOs do differently? We see key differences about how they approach change, bring people along with the AI vision, and provide access to AI tools.

We know that 60% of leaders worry their organization's leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement Al1. In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\\nWhat does this mean? Typical organizations are struggling to help individual contributors connect the dots between micro-value (how AI helps me individually) to macro-value (how AI helps my organization).

This may cause employee hesitance to share with their peers and leaders how they are using AI in their day-to-day.\\nEncouraging Al experimentation-the testing and sharing of what worked and what didn't - provides highly useful information, uncovering valuable AI use-cases across roles.\\nUnderstanding the most impactful way to use AI helps move from an aspirational AI vision to one that is tangible, already tested, and rooted in the real experiences of your employees. Providing access to AI tools creates an atmosphere that will encourage more experimentation, frequent use, and the sharing of experiences.\\n83% of employees at HPOs say they have opportunities to integrate AI into their work. Only 56% of employees at typical organizations say the same.\\nHPOs are providing access to organization- sponsored AI tools at a substantially higher rate than typical organizations and in turn are seeing more frequent use of AI. HPO employees are more likely to report that they understand where AI could be integrated in their work (87% at HPOs versus 67% at typical organizations) and more likely to have opportunities to integrate AI tools at work (83% at HPOs versus 56% at typical organizations).\\nThis experimentation is likely fueling a virtuous loop from use to realized value, in that more experimentation leads to greater realized value and vice versa. We see that 87% of those at HPOs agree there is value in integrating AI to their workplace versus 64% of employees at typical organizations.\\nExtent of organization-sponsored AI tools much higher at HPOs, which could be driving high use frequency for HPO employees\\nAmount of AI tools provided by their organization\\nAll\\n48%\\n26%\\nMost\\n27%\\n31%\\nSome\\n19%\\n32%\\nNone\\n6%\\n9%\\nHPO\\nTypical organization\\nFrequency of AI tool use\\nHigh\\n47%\\n22%\\nMod\\n29%\\n30%\\nLow\\n13%\\n26%\\nNever\\n10%\\n20%\\nHPO\\nTypical organization\\nLow frequency = A few times a month or less Moderate frequency = At least once a week High frequency = At least once a day\", \"Employees, not organizations, are leading the charge on AI integration at work. In our study, a staggering 80% of employees say they already use AI tools at work. The 2024 Microsoft Work Trend Index (WTI), reports similar rates of use, with 75% of knowledge indicating they use AI at work.\\nMounting evidence also points to employees not waiting for their companies to offer AI tools before finding solutions to enhance their own work. This creates a 'bring your own Al' (BYOAI) scenario1.\\nOnly about 1/3 of employees are using solely organization- provided AI tools\\nAll tools are provided\\nNone provided\\n30%\\n8%\\n29%\\n30%\\nMost tools are provided\\nSome tools are provided\\nHow many AI tools that you use are provided by your organization?\\n80%\", \"HPOs provide far more access to AI tools than typical organizations, with 48% from HPOs versus 26% from typical organizations saying all AI tools they use are provided by their organization. This creates space for more use and organization-supported experimentation. Experimentation can be highly valuable in uncovering AI use-cases and scenarios that drive value for individuals, teams, and the organization.\\nAs you consider the most impactful AI use-cases for your organization, remember AI is not a one- size-fits all solution and can be tailored to unique needs. Often, this means different functions and\\nroles find differing value across the variety of AI capabilities available.\\nUse the Microsoft Copilot Scenario Library to start your experimentation journey. Explore different AI use-cases, key performance indictors, and potential benefits of AI use by role. Consider this a jump-start to thoughtful implementation and continue to iterate and co-create additional scenarios with your people. Have employees test, provide feedback, and generate new ideas that surface as they use AI in their work.\\nExperimentation can take many forms, varying on level of structure (informal versus organized) and relatedness to a particular role (general versus specific). Use a mix of experimentation methods, consider what methods have been successful in the past and how multiple methods may work together. Informal, general testing can be useful as people are getting used to AI at work. Organized and specific testing is necessary as substantial AI investments and systemic workflow integrations are made.\", \"Just as we saw differences across levels in change experience, a gap is also seen when we look at the perceived value that AI can provide. We know that 60% of leaders worry their organization's leadership lacks a plan and vision to implement Al1. In this study, about half of individual contributors say they see the value of integrating AI in their own work, but only 28% see AI as critical to their organization's success.\\nIndividual contributors more naturally see how AI can benefit their own work but have a disconnect in seeing how these benefits ladder up to organizational goals. Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap. Not only are employees at HPOs more ready for AI transformation, but they have a greater sense that their organizations will benefit from AI. Individual contributors at HPOs have an average of +35 percentage points higher agreement on the organizational value of AI compared to individual contributors at typical organizations.\\nWhat does this mean? Typical organizations are struggling to help individual contributors connect the dots between micro-value (how AI helps me individually) to macro-value (how AI helps my organization).

Individual contributors can see the 'what's in it for me' but are struggling with the 'what's in it for us'- which could be due to a lack of clear vision.\\nGaps between senior level leaders and individual contributors are not necessarily uncommon, but\\ndifferences in perceived AI value poses a risk to successful adoption and a potential for the gap to continue growing if leaders do not intentionally define and clarify their vision for AI.\\nIf leaders do not help their people understand both how the investment in AI is helping their own work and driving organizational success, we may see a lack of motivation to support organization-level adoption initiatives. Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap.

Potential job loss or deskilling due to AI taking over tasks traditionally done by humans.\\nAddressing the concerns for your people is an important part of managing potential change resistance. To do this, uncover what the top concerns are for your organization through ongoing feedback mechanisms. Communicate what security efforts are in place to ensure the safety and accuracy of AI use. Provide skilling where AI has been integrated, both reskilling where there may be automation, and upskilling where AI may shift a workflow. As you begin to rollout AI, share success stories and quick wins.\\nFear around AI may be driven by the unknown. Exposure can be helpful in reducing apprehension even for AI skeptics or people who do not feel tech savvy. Don't discount the value of surfacing concerns, this builds trust that key risks are not being overlooked and helps refine and improve your AI strategy.\"], \"expected_output\": \"The study describes a positive relationship between AI use frequency and employee engagement, indicating that higher AI usage is associated with increased engagement levels among employees [doc_1].

This may cause employee hesitance to share with their peers and leaders how they are using AI in their day-to-day.\\nEncouraging Al experimentation-the testing and sharing of what worked and what didn't - provides highly useful information, uncovering valuable AI use-cases across roles.\\nUnderstanding the most impactful way to use AI helps move from an aspirational AI vision to one that is tangible, already tested, and rooted in the real experiences of your employees. Providing access to AI tools creates an atmosphere that will encourage more experimentation, frequent use, and the sharing of experiences.\\n83% of employees at HPOs say they have opportunities to integrate AI into their work. Only 56% of employees at typical organizations say the same.\\nHPOs are providing access to organization- sponsored AI tools at a substantially higher rate than typical organizations and in turn are seeing more frequent use of AI. HPO employees are more likely to report that they understand where AI could be integrated in their work (87% at HPOs versus 67% at typical organizations) and more likely to have opportunities to integrate AI tools at work (83% at HPOs versus 56% at typical organizations).\\nThis experimentation is likely fueling a virtuous loop from use to realized value, in that more experimentation leads to greater realized value and vice versa. We see that 87% of those at HPOs agree there is value in integrating AI to their workplace versus 64% of employees at typical organizations.\\nExtent of organization-sponsored AI tools much higher at HPOs, which could be driving high use frequency for HPO employees\\nAmount of AI tools provided by their organization\\nAll\\n48%\\n26%\\nMost\\n27%\\n31%\\nSome\\n19%\\n32%\\nNone\\n6%\\n9%\\nHPO\\nTypical organization\\nFrequency of AI tool use\\nHigh\\n47%\\n22%\\nMod\\n29%\\n30%\\nLow\\n13%\\n26%\\nNever\\n10%\\n20%\\nHPO\\nTypical organization\\nLow frequency = A few times a month or less Moderate frequency = At least once a week High frequency = At least once a day\", \"The bar chart compares high-performing organizations (HPOs) and typical organizations regarding AI tool provision and usage frequency. 48% of HPOs provide many AI tools, compared to 26% of typical organizations. Both groups mostly provide a moderate number of tools (27% HPO, 31% typical), while 19% HPOs and 32% typical organizations provide only a few, and 6% HPOs versus 9% typical organizations provide none. Regarding usage, 47% of HPO employees use AI tools daily, against 22% in typical organizations, with 29% HPOs and 30% typical organizations using tools moderately. Rare use occurs in 13% of HPOs and 26% of typical organizations, while 10% of HPO employees and 20% of typical employees never use AI tools.\", \"The bar chart illustrates that higher AI usage frequency is associated with more favorable employee experiences across metrics. Percentages of respondents with positive responses increase with AI use: Engagement (95% at high frequency), Recommend (89%), Retention (91%), Individual productivity (93%), and Team productivity (84%). The data compares four AI use levels: Never, Low frequency (a few times a month or less), Moderate frequency (at least once a week), and High frequency (at least once a day).\", \"The connection between engaged employees and better business performance3 is well- established. In this study, we see engagement is not only related to use frequency, but also support for and value derived from AI.\\nUltimately, engaged employees are more supportive of AI integration in their workplace and are eager to contribute to the success of the transformation. Engaged employees are also reporting more positive outcomes of AI adoption. We call this set of outcomes RIVA, or Realized Individual Value of AI. RIVA encapsulates a myriad of ways that an employee might see a direct impact of AI use on their day- to-day, such as completing tasks faster or reducing work-related stress.\\nEngaged employees are 2.6x as likely to say they fully support AI integration and are eager to contribute to AI transformation success\\nWhen we think of all the ways AI can support an employee, those who are already engaged are findings ways to capitalize on that value. Engaged employees have higher RIVA, with scores averaging 19 percentage points higher, even when controlling for high frequency use.\\nWhen an employee's RIVA is high, it indicates success in translating their AI use into tangible benefits, which may be spurring even more use of the tool. Thirty-four percent of engaged employees are high frequency users versus only 12% of non-engaged employees. We hypothesize that the more benefits users see, the more likely they are to be motivated and inspired to continue leveraging AI, leading to a virtuous cycle between ongoing use and realized value of AI.\", \"Transformation, of any kind, is all about behavioral change. The use of AI is often overlaid on top of products or processes that people are already using in their day-to-day. This means with Al transformation we're both asking people to create new habits and break old ones.\\nWe talk about employee engagement as the degree to which employees invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energies toward positive organizational outcomes. Successful AI transformation strategies will consider how a strong employee experience (EX) and an engaged workforce can serve as a foundation for and accelerant of AI adoption.\\nEncouragingly, this study finds early indication that AI use does have a positive relationship with key employee experiences. Favorability on engagement, among other outcomes, increases with frequency of AI use. High frequency (at least once a day) users score highest across the employee outcomes.\\nSelf-report measures of productivity-which we often think of as a key benefit of Al use-also increase with more frequent use. Interestingly, the largest experience increase across use frequency is engagement. Engagement jumps 18 percentage points from the low to moderate AI use frequency groups.\\nWhile these findings are correlational in nature (not causal), it's worth taking note that Al use and engagement are not unrelated.

Providing access to AI tools creates an atmosphere that will encourage more experimentation, frequent use, and the sharing of experiences.\\n83% of employees at HPOs say they have opportunities to integrate AI into their work. Only 56% of employees at typical organizations say the same.\\nHPOs are providing access to organization- sponsored AI tools at a substantially higher rate than typical organizations and in turn are seeing more frequent use of AI. HPO employees are more likely to report that they understand where AI could be integrated in their work (87% at HPOs versus 67% at typical organizations) and more likely to have opportunities to integrate AI tools at work (83% at HPOs versus 56% at typical organizations).\\nThis experimentation is likely fueling a virtuous loop from use to realized value, in that more experimentation leads to greater realized value and vice versa.

Managers also score substantially lower than leaders, uncovering an opportunity for better cascading of the AI vision.\\nAt HPOs we see less of a gap.
